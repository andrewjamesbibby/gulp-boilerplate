# gulp-boilerplate
Basic starting point for using gulp 

To start run ``` npm install ``` This will install all node modules. In development run ``` gulp watch ``` to compile any scss and activate browser live reload. 

To create a build run ``` gulp build ``` this will create a dist folder where the fully built files will be placed.
